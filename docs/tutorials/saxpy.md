# Tutorial: SAXPY - Hello, HIP

This tutorial will show you some of the basic concepts of the single-source HIP
programming model, the most essential tooling around it and briefly rehash some
commonalities of heterogenous APIs in general. Mild familiarity with the C/C++
compilation model and the language is assumed throughout this article.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this tutorial you will need properly installed drivers and a
HIP compiler toolchain to compile your code. Because HIP provided by ROCm
supports compiling and running on Linux and Windows with AMD and NVIDIA GPUs
alike, the combination of install instructions are more then worth covering as
part of this tutorial. Please refer to {doc}`/how_to_guides/install` on how to
install HIP development packages.

## Heterogenous Programming

Heterogenous programming and offloading APIs are often mentioned together.
Heterogenous programming deals with devices of varying capabilities at once
while the term offloading focuses on the "remote" and asnychronous aspect of
the computation. HIP encompasses both: it exposes GPGPU (General Purpose GPU)
programming much like ordinary host-side CPU programming and let's us move data
to and from device as need be.

```{important}
Most of the HIP-specific code will deal with "where", "what" and "how".
```

One thing to keep in mind while programming in HIP (and other heterogenous APIs
for that matter), is that target devices are built for a specific purpose. They
are designed with different tradeoffs than traditional CPUs and therefore have
very different performance characteristics. Ever so subtle changes in code may
effect execution time adversely. Rest assured one can always find the root
cause and design a fix.

## Your First Piece of HIP Code

First, let's take the "Hello, World!" of GPGPU: SAXPY. The name comes from
math, a vector equation at that: `a * x + y = z` where `a ‚àà ‚Ñù` is a scalar and
`x,y,z ‚àà ùïç` are vector quantities of some large dimensionality. (Allow us to
omit defining what vectors and vector spaces are in the mathematical sense.)
From a practical perspective we can compute this using a single `for` loop over
3 arrays.

```c++
for (int i = 0 ; i < N ; ++i)
    z[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
```

In linear algebra libraries, such as BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subsystem) this
operation is defined as AXPY "A times X Plus Y". The "S" comes from
single-precision, meaning that every element of our array are `float`s (our
vector space was defined over the set of reals).

To get quickly off the ground, we'll take off-the-shelf piece of code, the set
of [HIP samples from GitHub](https://github.com/amd/rocm-examples/). Assuming
Git is on your Path, open a command-line and navigate to where you'll want to
work, then issue:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/amd/rocm-examples.git
```

Inside the repo, you should find `HIP-Basic\saxpy\main.hip` which is a
sufficiently simple implementation of SAXPY. It was already mentioned
that HIP code will mostly deal with where and when data has to be and
how devices will transform it. The very first HIP calls deal with
allocating device-side memory and dispatching data from host-side
memory in a C Runtime-like fashion.

```hip
// Allocate and copy vectors to device memory.
float* d_x{};
float* d_y{};
HIP_CHECK(hipMalloc(&d_x, size_bytes));
HIP_CHECK(hipMalloc(&d_y, size_bytes));
HIP_CHECK(hipMemcpy(d_x, x.data(), size_bytes, hipMemcpyHostToDevice));
HIP_CHECK(hipMemcpy(d_y, y.data(), size_bytes, hipMemcpyHostToDevice));
```

`HIP_CHECK` is a custom macro borrowed from the examples utilities which
checks the error code returned by API functions for errors and reports them to
the console. It's not quintessential to the API.

If you're wondering: how does it know which device to allocate on / dispatch
to... wonder no more. Commands are issued to the HIP runtime on a per-thread
basis and every thread has a device set as the target of commands. The default
device is `0`, which is equivalent to calling `hipSetDevice(0)`.

Once our data has been dispatched, we can launch our calculation on the device.

```hip
__global__ void saxpy_kernel(const float a, const float* d_x, float* d_y, const unsigned int size)
{
    ...
}

int main()
{
    ...

    // Launch the kernel on the default stream.
    saxpy_kernel<<<dim3(grid_size), dim3(block_size), 0, hipStreamDefault>>>(a, d_x, d_y, size);
}
```

First let's discuss the signature of the offloaded function:

- `__global__` instructs the compiler to generate code for this function as an
  entrypoint to a device program, such that it can be launched from the host.
- The function does not return anything, because there is no trivial way to
  construct a return channel of a parallel invocation. Device-side entrypoints
  may not return a value, their results should be communicated using out
  params.
- Device-side functions are typically called compute kernels, or just kernels
  for short. This is to distinguish them from non-graphics-related graphics
  shaders, or just shaders for short.
- Arguments are taken by value and all arguments shall be
  [TriviallyCopyable](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/TriviallyCopyable),
  meaning they should be `memcpy`-friendly. _(Imagine if they had custom copy
  constructors. Where would that logic execute? On the host? On the device?)_
  Pointer arguments are pointers to device memory, one typically backed by
  VRAM.
- We said that we'll be computing `a * x + y = z`, however we only pass two
  pointers to the function. We'll be canonically reusing one of the inputs as
  outputs.

There's quite a lot to unpack already. How is this function launched from the
host? Using a language extension, the so-called triple chevron syntax. Inside
the angle brackets we can provide the following:

- The number of blocks to launch (our grid size)
- The number of threads in a block (our block size)
- The amount of shared memory to allocate by the host
- The device stream to enqueue the operation on

Following the triple chevron is ordinary function argument passing. Now let's
take a look how the kernel is implemented.

```hip
__global__ void saxpy_kernel(const float a, const float* d_x, float* d_y, const unsigned int size)
{
    // Compute the current thread's index in the grid.
    const unsigned int global_idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    // The grid can be larger than the number of items in the vectors. Avoid out-of-bounds addressing.
    if(global_idx < size)
    {
        d_y[global_idx] = a * d_x[global_idx] + d_y[global_idx];
    }
}
```

- The unique linear index identifying the thread is computed from the block id
  the thread is a member of, the block's size and the id of the thread within
  the block.
- A check is made to avoid overindexing the input.
- The useful part of the computation is carried out.

Retrieval of the result from the device is done much like its dispatch:

```hip
HIP_CHECK(hipMemcpy(y.data(), d_y, size_bytes, hipMemcpyDeviceToHost));
```

## Compiling on the Command-Line

(setting_up_the_command-line)=

### Setting Up the Command-Line

While strictly speaking there's no such thing as "setting up the command-line
for compilation" on Linux, just to make invocations more terse let's do it on
both Linux and Windows.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Linux
:sync: linux

While distro maintainers may package ROCm such that they install to
system-default locations, AMD's installation don't and need to be added to the
Path by the user.

```bash
export PATH=/opt/rocm/bin:${PATH}
```

You should be able to call the compiler on the command-line now:

```bash
amdclang++ --version
```

:::
:::{tab-item} Windows
:sync: windows

Windows compilers and command-line tooling have traditionally
relied on extra environemntal variables and Path entries to function correctly.
Visual Studio refers to command-lines with these setup as "Developer
Command-Line". The HIP SDK on Windows doesn't ship a complete toolchain, you
will also need:

- the Windows SDK, most crucially providing the import libs to crucial system
  libraries all executables must link to and some auxiliary compiler tooling.
- a Standard Template Library, aka. STL, which HIP too relies on. The prior may
be installed separately, though it's most conveniently obtained through the
Visual Studio installer, while the latter is part of the Microsoft Visual C++
compiler, aka. MSVC.

If you don't already have some SKU of Visual Studio 2022 installed, for a
minimal command-line experience, install the
[Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe)
with the Desktop Developemnt Workload and under Individual Components select:

- some version of the Windows SDK
- "MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest)"
- "C++ CMake tools for Windows" (optional)

```{tip}
The "C++ CMake tools for Windows" individual component is a convenience which
puts both `cmake.exe` and `ninja.exe` onto the `PATH` inside developer
command-prompts. You can install these manually, but then you need to manage
these tools manually.
```

The first Visual Studio 2022 SKU install location is in an environmental
variable `VS2022INSTALLDIR`. To setup a command-line with this compiler's STL
set in the `INCLUDE` env var, issue from PowerShell:

```pwsh
Import-Module $env:VS2022INSTALLDIR\Common7\Tools\Microsoft.VisualStudio.DevShell.dll
Enter-VsDevShell -InstallPath $env:VS2022INSTALLDIR -SkipAutomaticLocation -DevCmdArguments "-arch=x64 -host_arch=x64 -no_logo"
$env:PATH += ";${env:HIP_PATH}bin"
```

You should be able to call the compiler on the command-line now:

```pwsh
clang++ --version
```

### Invoking the Compiler Manually

:::
::::

To compile and link a single-file application, one may use the following
command:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Linux
:sync: linux

```bash
amdclang++ ./HIP-Basic/saxpy/main.hip -o saxpy -I ./Common -lamdhip64 -L /opt/rocm/lib -O2
```

:::
:::{tab-item} Windows
:sync: windows

```pwsh
clang++ .\HIP-Basic\saxpy\main.hip -o saxpy.exe -I .\Common -lamdhip64 -L ${env:HIP_PATH}lib -O2
```

:::
::::

Depending on your computer, the resulting binary may or may not run. If not, it
will typically complain about about "Invalid device function". That error
(corresponding to the `hipErrorInvalidDeviceFunction` entry of `hipError_t`)
means that the runtime could not find a device program binary of the
appropriate flavor embedded into the executable.

So far we've only talked about how our data makes it from the host to the
device and back. We've also seen our device code as source, but the HIP runtime
was arguing about not finding the right binary to dispatch for execution. How
can one find out what device binary flavors are embedded into the executable?

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Linux
:sync: linux

The set of `roc-*` utilities shipping with ROCm help significantly to inspect
binary artifacts on disk. If you wish to use these utilities, add the ROCmCC
installation folder to your PATH (the utilities expect them to be on the PATH).

Lisitng of the embedded program binaries can be done using `roc-obj-ls`

```bash
roc-obj-ls ./saxpy
```

It may return something like:

```shell
1       host-x86_64-unknown-linux         file://./saxpy#offset=12288&size=0
1       hipv4-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx803   file://./saxpy#offset=12288&size=9760
```

We can see that the compiler embedded a version 4 code object (more on code
object versions
[here](https://www.llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#code-object-metadata)) and
used the LLVM target triple `amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx803` (more on target triples
[here](https://www.llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#target-triples)). We can
extract that program object in a disassembled fashion for human consumption via
`roc-obj`

```bash
roc-obj -t gfx803 -d ./saxpy
```

Which will create two files on disk and we'll be interested in the one with the
`.s` extension. Opening up said file or dumping it to the console using `cat`
one will find the disassembled binary of our saxpy compute kernel, something
similar to:

```none

    flat_load_dword v3, v[0:1]           // 000000001068: DC500000 03000000

    s_endpgm                             // 000000001088: BF810000
```

Alternatively we can call the compiler with `--save-temps` to dump all device
binary to disk in separate files.

```bash
amdclang++ ./HIP-Basic/saxpy/main.hip -o saxpy -I ./Common -lamdhip64 -L /opt/rocm/lib -O2 --save-temps
```

Now we can list all the temporaries created while compiling `main.hip` via

```bash
ls main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-*
main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx803.bc
main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx803.cui
main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx803.o
main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx803.out
main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx803.out.resolution.txt
main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx803.s
```

Files with the `.s` extension hold the disassembled contents of the binary and
the filename directly informs us of the graphics IPs used by the compiler. The
contents of this file is very similar to what `roc-obj` printed to the console.

:::
:::{tab-item} Windows
:sync: windows

The HIP SDK for Windows don't yet sport the `roc-*` set of utilities to work
with binary artifacts. To find out what binary formats are embedded into an
executable, one may use `dumpbin` tool from the Windows SDK to obtain the
raw data of the `.hip_fat` section of an executable. (This binary payload is
what gets parsed by the `roc-*` set of utilities on Linux.) Skipping over the
reported header, the rendered raw data as ASCII has ~3 lines per entries.
Depending on how many binaries are embedded, you may need to alter the number
of rendered lines. An invocation such as:

```pwsh
dumpbin.exe /nologo /section:.hip_fat /rawdata:8 .\saxpy.exe | select -Skip 20 -First 12
```

The output may look like:

```none

[here](https://www.llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#code-object-metadata)) and
used the LLVM target triple `amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx906` (more on target triples
[here](https://www.llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#target-triples)). Don't be
alarmed about linux showing up as a binary format, AMDGPU binaries uploaded to
the GPU for execution are proper linux ELF binaries in their format.

Alternatively we can call the compiler with `--save-temps` to dump all device

Now that we know which versions of graphics IP our devices use, we can
recompile our program with said parameters.

```bash
amdclang++ ./HIP-Basic/saxpy/main.hip -o saxpy -I ./Common -lamdhip64 -L /opt/rocm/lib -O2 --offload-arch=gfx906:sramecc+:xnack-
```

Now our sample will surely run.
